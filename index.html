<br/>1) Is this a 24x7 support request:
<br/>
<br/>   Yes or No - If yes provide a rationale, and any expectations
<br/>   and/or special request of the L3 support team. The 24x7

<br/>   high business impact and production down issues including
<br/>   the full 24x7 availability of the customer as well.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>   NOTE: 24x7 designation aims to put higher weight on a request
<br/>   for support, and spans the entire work force involved in
<br/>   responding to it. It is not meant as a directive placed on
<br/>   any one individual or team.
<br/>
<br/>2) Statement of the problem:
<br/>
<br/>   Describe the problem as detailed as possible. Please also provide
<br/>   business impact this issue is having on customer, especially for
<br/>   severity 1 issues.
<br/>
<br/>3) Is the problem Reproducible? yes, by customer
<br/>
<br/>   Yes or No - If yes define who can reproduce it (L2, L3,
<br/>   customer only or a combination of that).
<br/>
<br/>4) Reproduction steps:
<br/>
<br/>   Clearly describe the step by step instructions how to
<br/>   reproduce the problem. Add links to available documentation
<br/>   or information about the test machine where the reproduction
<br/>   case is available and running.
<br/>
<br/>5) Product(s) version (incl. Fixpack Level) / DBMS Product & Version:
<br/>
<br/>   Define the exact release levels of the BPM product and related
<br/>   back-end systems involved (like the database, ECM system or others).
<br/>   Add a link where to find the detailed version information.
<br/>
<br/>6) L2 Engineer analysis:
<br/>
<br/>   Describe the analysis from L2 side and which exact assets (PI, TWX,
<br/>   logs, traces, dumps and others) were used and what the findings are.
<br/>
<br/>7) MustGather info - Logs and Traces:
<br/>
<br/>   Add links to all relevant assets on ECUREP (logs, traces and so on).
<br/>   In case of a Blue Diamond ticket define clearly where the related
<br/>   assets are stored on the Blue Diamond network shares.
<br/>
<br/>8) Have you had a peer review by another L2?
<br/>
<br/>   Yes or No - If yes who was the reviewer, if no define why.
